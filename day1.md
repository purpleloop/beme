Day 1

Il look through the window, lost in my thoughts.
I feel a little tight in my clothes. It has always bien like that whatsoevrer.
I always felt there was something misaligned in me, like à jigsaw puzzle piece that doesnt fit. Not the one that obvously differs, but the one whose shade seams with others seems wrong, and after many times you the thing obsesses you, you realize it´s place is at the full opposite.
But life is not as easy as a puzzle game.
And now I feel physically thight, but in my mind,a strange joy rises as an evidence, the veil uncovers after so much time,the fact is, I am a woman.
